# Windows 7 simple
This is essentially the same as [my other Windows 7 skin](https://github.com/NoTouchingthePC/Windows-7-skin), but it has fewer options and is smaller in size (600 KB vs 1.3 MB).
## Installation
1. [Open-Shell 4.4.190](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases/latest) or later is required (due to the use of the new 120_DPI internal option).
2. Download the latest version of the skin [here](https://github.com/NoTouchingthePC/Windows-7-simple/releases/latest/).
3. Once downloaded, unzip the package and copy the skin to Open-Shell's Skins folder, then copy the taskbar textures, start button, and icons to %localappdata%\OpenShell.
4. In Open-Shell Menu Settings, load the Windows 7 XML from the skin's download folder.
5. Exit and restart the start menu to fully apply settings.

## Notes
The skin should work fully as intended. If you do come across an issue, make sure to report it [here](https://github.com/NoTouchingthePC/Windows-7-simple/issues) and I'll look into it and fix it if necessary. Before reporting an issue, ALWAYS check if the issue is present on other skins as well. If it's not just an issue with my skin, then you should report an issue for [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/issues) instead.
